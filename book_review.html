<!-- 
    This project was a big learning experience to me. It took me forever to figure out how to set up the page in a way
    that looked ok. I also misread the project and made different webpages instead of having the button that would show
    and hide a specific part of the page so I had to restart and use my 2 extra days that you give us. Also the scalability
    of the website was a PAIN to deal with, but I finally figured it out. If I did this again, I wouldnt have put the images
    in the aside, because I don't like how it looks in the mobile version. I would like the images to be next to the corresponding
    paragraphs at all times.

                    <h1>My Favorite Book Genre</h1>
                        <p>
                            My favorite genre of books to read is by far fantasy. There are so many
                            worlds that people build that are fascinating to get into. A lot of books
                            do follow similar tropes, but what makes them entertaining is how unique 
                            the different worlds are. New takes on old stories are fascinating, different
                            concepts with the same creatures is what keeps fantasy interesting.
                        </p>
                    <h1>Reading vs Cinema</h1>
                        <p>
                            I think reading will always have a place in the world, even though movies and 
                            tv shows are really taking over in entertainment. Books take very little material
                            resources to write, so anyone can make a story. Movies and shows are expensive to make
                            and they take up very little time compared to books. <br>
                            When reading you have to imagine what the author is telling you. The author created the 
                            world, but your mind is what makes it real. In movies you see the directors image, there is no room 
                            for you to imagine anything, you just consume what is put in front of you.
